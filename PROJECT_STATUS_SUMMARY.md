## 🏗️ Architecture Achievements

### ✅ OpenVPN Structure Reorganization (December 2024)
The project underwent a major restructure to create a clean, maintainable architecture:

#### Before (Mixed Architecture)
```
❌ Platform-specific code mixed in generic directories
❌ Duplicated OpenVPN implementations
❌ Complex build dependencies
❌ Maintenance difficulties
```

#### After (Clean Separation)
```
✅ Generic cross-platform OpenVPN library (openvpn/)
✅ Platform-specific bridges in platform directories
✅ Unified API across all platforms
✅ Modular build system
✅ Easy maintenance and extensibility
```

### File Structure (After Reorganization)
